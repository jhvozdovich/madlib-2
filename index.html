        <h1>A Scooby-Doo Mystery Adventure!</h1>
        <p>
          One day the gang was busy helping <span class="person1"></span> with a spooky mystery!
          It seemed <span class="person1"></span> was dealing with a <span class="monster"></span>. 
          Zoinks! What a problem! But Shaggy, Scooby, Velma, Daphne, and Fred are on the case!
          They were investigating the <span class="place1"></span> when suddenly there was a loud 
          <span class="scary-noise"></span>. "<span class="exclamation"></span>" said Shaggy!
          "We gotta get out of here!"
          <br>
          "Let's split up gang," Fred suggested.
          <br>
          Almost immediately half the gang was stuck in a <span class="trap"></span>
          <br>
          Thankfully Velma came prepared and got everyone out of the <span class="trap"></span> in a jiffy!
          "Let's get out of here gang," she said. "I think I figured out who the mastermind is terrorizing <span class="person1"></span>!"
          A few minutes of stealthy sneaking later, they nabbed the <span class="monster"></span>. 
          When the mask was removed everyone exclaimed <span class="villain"></span>! 
          "That's what I thought at first too," said Velma. "But actually, this is the true criminal!" 
          Everyone shouted when another mask was removed to reveal <span class="person1"></span> was behind it all along!
